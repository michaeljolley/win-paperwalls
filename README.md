## Requirements

- Windows 10 version 1809 (17763) or later
- Windows 11 recommended for best WinUI 3 experience
- .NET 9 Runtime (included with the application)

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 (version 17.8 or later) or .NET 9 SDK
- Windows App SDK 1.6 or later

### Build Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/michaeljolley/win-paperwalls.git
cd win-paperwalls

# Restore dependencies and build
dotnet restore
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run --project src/WinPaperWalls/WinPaperWalls.csproj
```

### Visual Studio

1. Open `win-paperwalls.slnx` in Visual Studio 2022
2. Right-click the solution in Solution Explorer and select "Restore NuGet Packages"
3. Press F5 to build and run

## Configuration

Settings are stored in: `%LocalAppData%\WinPaperWalls\settings.json`

The application provides a graphical settings UI accessible from the system tray icon. You can configure:

- **Rotation Interval:** How frequently to change wallpapers
- **Topic Selection:** Which topic categories to include/exclude
- **Wallpaper Style:** How the image is displayed on your desktop
- **Cache Size:** Maximum disk space for cached wallpapers (default 500 MB)
- **Startup Behavior:** Whether to start with Windows

## Usage

1. Launch WinPaperWalls - it will minimize to the system tray
2. Right-click the tray icon to access:
   - **Refresh PaperWall:** Immediately change to a new random wallpaper
   - **Settings:** Open the settings window to configure the application
   - **Exit:** Close the application
3. The wallpaper will automatically change based on your configured interval

## Cache Management

Downloaded wallpapers are cached in: `%LocalAppData%\WinPaperWalls\cache`

The cache uses a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction strategy when it exceeds the configured size limit. You can manually clear the cache from the Settings window.

## Architecture

- **Services Layer:** All business logic is in injectable services (SettingsService, GitHubImageService, CacheService, WallpaperService, SchedulerService)
- **Background Scheduler:** Uses .NET PeriodicTimer with IHostedService for reliable background processing
- **Thread Safety:** Settings and cache operations are thread-safe for concurrent access
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling with fallback to cached data when GitHub API is unavailable
