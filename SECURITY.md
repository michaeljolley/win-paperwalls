## Scope

This project is a Windows desktop application that automatically rotates
desktop wallpaper using images from a public GitHub repository. It makes
unauthenticated requests to the GitHub API and uses Win32 P/Invoke for
wallpaper management. The application does not collect or store user
credentials or personal data. However, we take all security reports seriously,
including:

- Data exfiltration risks
- Code injection vulnerabilities
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Win32 P/Invoke safety issues
- Privacy concerns beyond what's covered in our
  [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md)

Thank you for helping keep this project safe.
