# Releasing Weather for Command Palette

## Overview

This project uses an automated release pipeline via GitHub Actions. Creating a GitHub Release triggers a workflow that builds the extension, runs tests, creates MSIX packages, submits to the Microsoft Store, and publishes to WinGet.

## Prerequisites (One-Time Setup)

### 1. Microsoft Entra ID App Registration

1. Go to [Azure Portal → App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps)
2. Click **New registration**
3. Name it (e.g., "WeatherExtension CI")
4. Note the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**
5. Go to **Certificates & secrets** → **New client secret** → note the **Value**
6. In [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) → **Account Settings** → **User Management**
7. Add the application with **Manager** role

### 2. Partner Center IDs

1. **Seller ID:** Partner Center → **Account Settings** → **Organization profile** → **Identifiers**
2. **Product ID:** Partner Center → **Apps and Games** → select "Weather for Command Palette" → note the App ID from the URL

### 3. Azure Trusted Signing

The MSIX packages are signed using [Azure Trusted Signing](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/trusted-signing/) after building. This requires an Azure service principal with access to the signing account.

1. Ensure the Azure Trusted Signing account `bbb-signing` and certificate profile `BaldBeardedBuilder` are configured (shared with WalkThisWay)
2. Create an Azure service principal with access to the signing account
3. Store the service principal credentials as a GitHub secret named `AZURE_CREDS` in JSON format:
   ```json
   {
     "clientId": "<Application (client) ID>",
     "clientSecret": "<Client secret value>",
     "subscriptionId": "<Subscription ID>",
     "tenantId": "<Directory (tenant) ID>"
   }
   ```

### 4. WinGet Token

1. Go to [GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **Generate new token (classic)**
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "WinGet Releaser")
4. Select the `public_repo` scope
5. Generate and note the token value

> **Note:** The WinGet package identifier is `BaldBeardedBuilder.WeatherForCmdPal`. Before the first automated release, you must manually submit the initial package manifest to [microsoft/winget-pkgs](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs) using [`wingetcreate new`](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-create). Subsequent releases will be handled automatically.

### 5. Store Publisher Identity

The Microsoft Store requires a specific publisher identity in the MSIX manifest that differs from the Trusted Signing certificate subject. The release workflow builds **two sets** of packages:

- **Sideload/WinGet** — Uses the Trusted Signing publisher, signed with Azure Trusted Signing
- **Microsoft Store** — Uses the Store publisher identity (`STORE_PUBLISHER_NAME` secret), unsigned (Microsoft re-signs during Store publication)

To find your Store publisher identity:

1. Go to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) → **Apps and Games** → select your app
2. **Product management** → **Product Identity**
3. Copy the **Package/Identity/Publisher** value (e.g., `CN=A8D6094E-...`)

### 5. GitHub Repository Secrets

Go to the repo **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **New repository secret**. Add:

| Secret Name | Source |
|---|---|
| `PARTNER_CENTER_TENANT_ID` | Entra ID → Directory (tenant) ID |
| `PARTNER_CENTER_CLIENT_ID` | Entra ID → Application (client) ID |
| `PARTNER_CENTER_CLIENT_SECRET` | Entra ID → Client secret value |
| `PARTNER_CENTER_SELLER_ID` | Partner Center → Seller ID |
| `STORE_PRODUCT_ID` | Partner Center → Product/App ID |
| `AZURE_CREDS` | Azure service principal JSON for Trusted Signing |
| `STORE_PUBLISHER_NAME` | Partner Center → App Identity → Package/Identity/Publisher (e.g., `CN=...`) |
| `WINGET_TOKEN` | GitHub PAT with `public_repo` scope |

## How to Release

1. Ensure all changes are merged to `main`
2. Go to GitHub → **Releases** → **Create a new release**
3. Create a new tag using semantic versioning: `v1.0.1`, `v1.2.0`, etc.
4. Write release notes (or use auto-generated notes)
5. Click **Publish release**

The workflow automatically:
- Builds x64 and ARM64 architectures
- Runs all tests
- Creates MSIX packages
- Uploads MSIX packages to the release as downloadable artifacts
- Submits to the Microsoft Store
- Submits to WinGet (via PR to [microsoft/winget-pkgs](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs))

## Tag Naming Convention

- Format: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `v1.0.1`)
- The `v` prefix is stripped and `.0` is appended to create the 4-part version for the MSIX manifest (e.g., `1.0.1.0`)

## What Happens After Publishing

- The Microsoft Store reviews the submission (may take 1–3 business days)
- If approved, the update is available to users via the Store
- The MSIX packages attached to the GitHub Release can be used for sideloading

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Workflow fails at "Configure Store credentials" | Verify all 5 Partner Center GitHub secrets are set correctly |
| Store submission rejected | Check Partner Center dashboard for validation errors |
| WinGet submission fails | Verify `WINGET_TOKEN` secret is set and not expired. For the first release, manually submit using `wingetcreate new` |
| Build fails | The release workflow uses the same build process as CI — check for build errors in the Actions log |
