## Learnings

<!-- Append new learnings below. Each entry is something lasting about the project. -->

### 2026-04-24 - Phase 3: System Tray Icon Implementation

**What was built:**
- System tray icon using H.NotifyIcon.WinUI (v2.1.4) package
- Tray context menu with Next Wallpaper, Settings, and Exit options
- Modified app startup to launch minimized to tray (no visible window)
- MainWindow hides instead of closing when user clicks X
- P/Invoke for User32.ShowWindow to properly hide windows
- Placeholder tray-icon.ico created (16x16, minimal)

**Key decisions:**
- TrayIconView created as a UserControl (separate from App.xaml) for cleaner separation
- Used H.NotifyIcon.WinUI's TaskbarIcon component with ContextFlyout for menu
- ICommand implementation for double-click to open settings
- MainWindow registered as singleton in DI, created on-demand when Settings is clicked
- Exit properly calls Application.Current.Exit() to terminate the app completely

**Integration notes:**
- Biff had already created IWallpaperService, IGitHubImageService, ICacheService with full implementations
- Added Microsoft.Extensions.Http using statements to CacheService and GitHubImageService (they use IHttpClientFactory)
- App.xaml.cs already had HttpClient registration and all service DI setup from Biff's work
- WallpaperService.ChangeWallpaperAsync() is fully implemented and can be called from tray menu

**Cross-Agent Notes:**
- Biff (Phase 2) built GitHubImageService, CacheService, and WallpaperService with full implementations and proper DI registration
- All services exposed via well-defined interfaces: IGitHubImageService, ICacheService, IWallpaperService
- App.xaml.cs DI setup from Phase 2 already includes IHttpClientFactory and all service registrations
- Marty (Phase 3) did not need to modify any of Biff's services—tray menu integration was clean

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 4: Scheduler service for automatic wallpaper rotation based on `IntervalMinutes`
- Consider: Unit tests once test project architecture is resolved (see decisions.md)
- Consider: Toast notifications for wallpaper change feedback

### 2026-04-24 - Phase 4: WinUI 3 Settings Window

**What was built:**
- Complete settings window UI replacing placeholder
- Rotation interval selector with 7 preset options (30min to weekly) using ComboBox
- Topic selector with dynamic GitHub API loading using ItemsRepeater
- Select All/Deselect All buttons for topic management
- Wallpaper style selector (Fill/Fit/Stretch/Tile/Center/Span)
- Cache management section with live size display and clear functionality
- Start with Windows toggle using ToggleSwitch
- Save button with success notification using InfoBar
- Loading states with ProgressRing for async GitHub fetch
- Error handling with InfoBar for GitHub API failures

**Technical implementation:**
- Uses System.Net.Http.Json for ReadFromJsonAsync extension method
- TopicItem class implements INotifyPropertyChanged for two-way binding
- Fetches all topics directly from GitHub API (bypasses service's exclusion filter)
- Maps ComboBox selections via Tag properties for clean value extraction
- Settings loaded on first window activation (not in constructor)
- ICacheService.GetCacheSizeBytes() used for cache display
- All settings properly map to/from AppSettings model
- Window hides to tray instead of closing (preserves state)

**UI/UX decisions:**
- ScrollViewer with max-width 600px for clean desktop experience
- Sections separated by SubtitleTextBlockStyle headers
- InfoBars for success/error feedback (auto-hide after 3 seconds for success)
- Topics displayed in scrollable bordered container (max 200px height)
- NumberBox for cache size (100-2000 MB range with spinner)
- ContentDialog for cache clear confirmation and errors

**Integration with existing services:**
- ISettingsService for load/save operations
- IGitHubImageService interface defined but needed direct HTTP call for unfiltered topics
- ICacheService for GetCacheSizeBytes() and ClearCacheAsync()
- All services retrieved via App.Services.GetRequiredService<T>()
- Settings changes trigger ISettingsService.SettingsChanged event

**Data binding approach:**
- ObservableCollection<TopicItem> for dynamic topic list
- ItemsRepeater with DataTemplate for CheckBox items
- Two-way binding on TopicItem.IsSelected property
- Tag-based value extraction from ComboBox selections

**Next Steps:**
- Scheduler service needs to listen for SettingsChanged event
- Consider implementing StartupManager for "Start with Windows" functionality
- May need toast notifications when settings are saved
- Future: Add wallpaper preview in settings window

### 2026-04-24 - Cross-Phase: Phase 5 Scheduler & Startup Manager (Biff)

**What Biff built in Phase 5:**
- SchedulerService with PeriodicTimer for automatic wallpaper rotation at user-configured interval
- Immediate wallpaper change on app startup (no initial wait)
- Dynamic settings integration: listens to ISettingsService.SettingsChanged event and restarts timer with new interval
- Thread-safe timer restart logic with proper disposal of old timer and cancellation tokens
- NextChangeTime property exposed for UI display
- StartupManager for registry-based "Start with Windows" support
  - Uses HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
  - SetStartWithWindows(bool) and IsStartWithWindows() methods
  - Handles .dll→.exe path conversion for WinUI apps
- DI registration pattern: SchedulerService as singleton accessible via SchedulerService, ISchedulerService, and IHostedService
- Generic host automatically invokes StartAsync/StopAsync on app startup/shutdown

**Integration with Marty's Phase 4 work:**
- Scheduler listens to SettingsChanged event fired by Phase 4 settings window
- StartupManager called from SettingsWindow when user toggles "Start with Windows" toggle
- Phase 4 settings window serves as UI for scheduler interval configuration
- Settings persistence via ISettingsService properly flows to scheduler configuration

**Impact on Phase 4 functionality:**
- Phase 4 settings window now fully functional: interval changes trigger scheduler restart with no manual app restart needed
- "Start with Windows" toggle in Phase 4 now backed by StartupManager registry operations
- Scheduler provides automatic wallpaper rotation when app is running
- Combined with Phase 3 tray menu, user has both automatic (scheduler) and manual (Next Wallpaper menu item) control
